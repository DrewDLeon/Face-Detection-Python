# Face-Detection-Python
A simple but efective face detection program using python

### Libraries used:
- Cv2 link: (https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)

### How does it work
Using the haar cascades file that I uploaded the program uses the algorithm trained to check on your face if there's any coincidence with what a "face" should look like,
then, it writes on a list the coordinates in the screen where the face starts, and where the face ends, so you just need to match the points and draw a rectangle around.
